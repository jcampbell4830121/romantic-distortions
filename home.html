	<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

	<p>Nostalgia and memory is interwoven in our everyday lives, and affects many of the choices we make. This project aims to understand the positive, negative, and neutral benefits nostalgia has on us through a niche editorial publication. We also explore people’s lives or careers who are entwined with memory and nostalgia on a daily basis. As an additional asset, we also explore the intensely personal nature of nostalgia through an instagram account that collects and illustrates memories anonymously. The audience of this project is those interested in pop culture, psychology, and history.</p>

	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>This project was inspired by a personal love of nostalgia and pop culture books, and the feelings they can create even when you haven’t lived through that time period. I wanted to create a publication that explores the concept from a universal standpoint and does not cater only to a specific generation. After all, nostalgia is a universal feeling, but also instensely personal since everyone’s experiences and memories differ.</p>

	  <p>I was also fascinated by the positive and negative effects that nostalgia can have on our brain, and how it is used as a therapeutic device for emotional wellness in different stages of life.</p>

	<p>Once I realized how much I wanted to explore this topic from many angles, I felt a magazine was the best approach, to explore the topic with different interviews, while also interspersing with personal memories and nostalgia that I collected through surveys.</p>

	<p> As a publication design lover, I was inspired by similar niche pubications such as Anxy and Weapons of Reason, that explore a single topic in depth coupled with great design.

	<h1> Process </h1>

	<p>I did some initial research on nostalgia, and then started reaching out for interviews from different people. I wanted to interviews a wide breadth of people within the time I had, so the magazine would have a good variety of content. These interviews included:</p>
	<ul>	
	<li>DJ Jake Rudh - hosts Transmission radio show playing music of the 80s. Also hosts nostalgic dance and halloween nights</li>
	<li>Wild Things Antiques - exploring the memories behind objects and the community it creates</li>
	<li>Minnesota Historical Society - exploring the House of Memories app created to help those with Dementia connect with loved ones</li>
	<li>Music Therapist - how music helps our memories and create peace within us.</li>
	<li>Also gathered responses from people about what makes them feel nostalgic to touch on the “intensely personal” side of nostalgia</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I then edited the interviews, flowed them into the magazine, and created editorial illustrations and layouts that would be engaging and interesting for the readers. I want the publication to feel “alive.”

	  <p> I also took the anonymous survey responses I received, and began to hand letter the responses and post the memory associated with them on a separate instagram account. </p>

	<h1> Summary and Next steps</h1>

	<p> Overall, I enjoyed learning about this topic and how nostalgia is ingrained in our lives in many ways. For next steps, I think it would be fun to consider more publications based on specific decades, and continue to expand my instagram account with more memories. I would also like to add a motion graphics piece to this project.</p>
